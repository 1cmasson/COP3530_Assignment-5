This program was not finding and path of finding the most profitable exchange for each currency, it was just looking fo the most profitable exchange. The reason why the Bellman Ford algorithm was used for this problems is because Bellman Ford will alert you when the path is crossing negative integers. Those negative integers wouldve had Dijkstra shortest path in an infinite loop. This algorithm goes through every possible node and records the most profitable exchange in each of the nodes.
